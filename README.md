# Poisson Graphical Models and Their Extensions

This repository contains an independent replication and evaluation of **Poisson Graphical Models (PGM)** and their two extensions: the **Quadratic PGM (QPGM)** and **Sublinear PGM (SPGM)**, originally proposed in Yang et al. (2013). These models are used to estimate sparse graphical structures in count-valued data, with applications in biological and biomedical domains.

The project includes:
- Custom implementation of simulation and model fitting routines in R
- Structural recovery evaluation using precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC
- Application to breast cancer miRNA expression data from TCGA

## Project Overview

Graphical models are powerful tools for learning the dependency structure among multivariate variables. While Gaussian Graphical Models are widely used, they are not well-suited for count data. This motivates the use of **Poisson Graphical Models**, which directly model counts via exponential family distributions.

However, standard PGMs impose non-positivity constraints on edge weights. The QPGM and SPGM address this by:
- QPGM: Introducing a **quadratic base measure**, enabling both positive and negative interactions.
- SPGM: Using a **sublinear transformation** on the sufficient statistics to allow more flexible dependency modeling and heavier tails.

## Simulation Studies

We conducted large-scale simulations to evaluate model recovery:

- **PGM**: Replicated success-rate curves under 2D lattice graphs, using ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-penalized Poisson regression (`glmnet`).  
- **QPGM & SPGM**: Simulated data from scale-free graphs using positive edge weights. Recovery metrics were computed after fitting via `optim()` with ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ penalty.

Results show that:
- PGM recovers structure well under large sample sizes.
- SPGM achieves higher accuracy than QPGM under positive dependencies.
- Our models required larger samples than originally reported to reach similar performance.

## Real Data Application

We applied QPGM and SPGM to breast cancer miRNA expression data from **TCGA** (n = 445, p = 353). Preprocessing followed the pipeline in the `XMRF` package. Model fitting was done via node-wise likelihood maximization using custom optimizers. The resulting networks are sparse and biologically interpretable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Code and Implementation

All code is written in base R and includes:

- Simulation scripts for PGM, QPGM, SPGM
- Penalized likelihood estimation routines (using `glmnet` or `optim`)
- Graph recovery metrics and plotting utilities

We avoided relying on the `XMRF` package due to its numerical instability and reproducibility issues, and instead re-implemented all methods from scratch.
